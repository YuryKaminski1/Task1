Honestly, what will become of me?
Don't like reality, it's way too clear to me
But really, life is dandy
We are what we don't see, miss everything daydreaming

Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end?

Traveling, I only stop at exits
Wondering if I'll stay
Young and restless
Living this way, I stress less

Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end?


Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end?
